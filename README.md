# Github-Api-Magic
Using GitHub API to make a web app with vanilla js that fetches GitHub user data.

You can read tutorial for building this here.

You can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsmadhusudhan) or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/itsmadhusudhan) if you have something to say.

Below is how our app looks initially. It's just static page.

### 1. Enter the user id/login id/username of github you want to search like below and wait

### 2. If the username is found below details are displayed.

### 3. If the username is not found then it displays No Information Found.

I can't say this is compatible in all browsers and also it's not transpiled.

Please feel free to fork and pull requests to add more features.
